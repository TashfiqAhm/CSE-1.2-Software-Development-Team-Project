# CSE-1.2-Software-Development-Team-Project
A project to be developed by a team of 3 or 2 students.


Students had to develop an advance software using deifferent functions of iGraphics.
The software required the implementation of structures, file management and the functions 
must be divided into several header files according to their use. Also the source-code had 
to be clean and must have sufficient ammount of commenting to describe the use of the 
functions so that it may help future developers to understand them.
It also allows the software to  be modular.

The final result was a game named "Battle For the world".
  
Running the software will require the installation of Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 ultimate 
along with other components.The installation process of these are given in the attached pdf.

A video about the softwares user-interface and other parts is attached with the software.
